Hello, my name is Jeffrey Walley. I'm in my 3rd semester of a Cyber Security Associates degree. I work part-time at Whole Foods in Shreveport along with my studies. This semester I am taking CTEC-165, 170, and 172, and I will be attempting my CompTIA Network+ certification. I look forward to meeting you and working with some of you in the future.Â I plan on spending 8-10 hours weekly, per course, to complete my course work.
