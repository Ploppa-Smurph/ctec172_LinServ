<h2>ch08 Managing and Monitoring Linux</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
In this chapter, you learned:
    - A process is a running instance of an executable program. Processes are assigned a state, which can be running, sleeping, stopped, or zombie. The ps command is used to list processes.
    - Each terminal is its own session and can have foreground process and independent background processes. The jobs command displays processes within a terminal session.
    - A signal is a software interrupt that reports events to an executing program. The kill, pkill, and killall commands use signals to control processes.
    - Load average is an estimate of how busy the system is. To display load average values, you can use the top, uptime, or w command.

<h2>ch09 Controlling Services and Daemons</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
In this chapter, you learned:
    - systemd provides a method for activating system resources, server daemons, and other processes, both at boot time and on a running system.
    - Use the systemctl to start, stop, reload, enable, and disable services.
    - Use the systemctl status command to determine the status of system daemons and network services started by systemd.
    - The systemctl list-dependencies command lists all service units upon which a specific service unit depends.
    - systemd can mask a service unit so that it does not run even to satisfy dependencies.

<h2>Lab Monitoring and Managing</h2>
You should be able to manage processes using top as a process management tool.
