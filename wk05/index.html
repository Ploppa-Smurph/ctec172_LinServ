<h3>Lab: Configuring and Securing SSH</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
In this chapter, you learned:
    - The ssh command allows users to access remote systems securely using the SSH protocol.
    - A client system stores remote servers' identities in ~/.ssh/known_hosts and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.
    - SSH supports both password-based and key-based authentication.
    - The ssh-keygen command generates an SSH key pair for authentication. The ssh-copy-id command exports the public key to remote systems.
    - The sshd service implements the SSH protocol on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
    - It is a recommended practice to configure sshd to disable remote logins as root and to require public key authentication rather than password-based authentication.
