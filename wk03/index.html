<h2>Chap 05 Creating, Viewing, Editing Files</h2>
<h3>outputting to terminal or to file</h3>
consider the following examples:

Save a time stamp for later reference.
    [user@host ~]$ date > /tmp/saved-timestamp

Copy the last 100 lines from a log file to another file.
    [user@host ~]$ tail -n 100 /var/log/dmesg > /tmp/last-100-boot-messages

Concatenate four files into one.
    [user@host ~]$ cat file1 file2 file3 file4 > /tmp/all-four-in-one

List the home directory's hidden and regular file names into a file.
    [user@host ~]$ ls -a > /tmp/my-file-names

Append output to an existing file.
    [user@host ~]$ echo "new line of information" >> /tmp/many-lines-of-information
    [user@host ~]$ diff previous-file current-file >> /tmp/tracking-changes-made

The next few commands generate error messages because some system directories are inaccessible to normal users. Observe as the error messages are redirected. Redirect errors to a file while viewing normal command output on the terminal.
    [user@host ~]$ find /etc -name passwd 2> /tmp/errors

Save process output and error messages to separate files.
    [user@host ~]$ find /etc -name passwd > /tmp/output 2> /tmp/errors

Ignore and discard error messages.
    [user@host ~]$ find /etc -name passwd > /tmp/output 2> /dev/null

Store output and generated errors together.
    [user@host ~]$ find /etc -name passwd &> /tmp/save-both

Append output and generated errors to an existing file.
    [user@host ~]$ find /etc -name passwd >> /tmp/save-both 2>&1
<h3>editing using VIM</h3>
- An i keystroke enters insert mode, where all text typed becomes file content. Pressing Esc returns to command mode.
- A v keystroke enters visual mode, where multiple characters may be selected for text manipulation. Use Shift+V for multiline and Ctrl+V for block selection. The same keystroke used to enter visual mode (v, Shift+V or Ctrl+V) is used to exit.
- The : keystroke begins extended command mode for tasks such as writing the file (to save it), and quitting the Vim editor.
<h3>Lab 05</h3>
1) On workstation, from the student home directory, use the ls -al command to redirect a long listing of all content to a file named editing_final_lab.txt.
    [student@workstation ~]$ ls -al > editing_final_lab.txt

<h3>Summary</h3>
In this chapter, you learned:
    - Running programs, or processes, have three standard communication channels, standard input, standard output, and standard error.
    - You can use I/O redirection to read standard input from a file or write the output or errors from a process to a file.
    - Pipelines can be used to connect standard output from one process to standard input of another process, and can be used to format output or build complex commands.
    - You should know how to use at least one command-line text editor, and Vim is generally installed.
    - Shell variables can help you run commands and are unique to a particular shell session.
    - Environment variables can help you configure the behavior of the shell or the processes it starts.
<h2>Chap 06 Managing Local User Groups</h2>
<h3>Lab 06 Managing Local Users and Groups</h3>
<h2>Summary</h2>
In this chapter, you learned:
    - There are three main types of user account: the superuser, system users, and regular users.
    - A user must have a primary group and may be a member of one or more supplementary groups.
    - The three critical files containing user and group information are /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow.
    - The su and sudo commands can be used to run commands as the superuser.
    - The useradd, usermod, and userdel commands can be used to manage users.
    - The groupadd, groupmod, and groupdel commands can be used to manage groups.
    - The chage command can be used to configure and view password expiration settings for users.
